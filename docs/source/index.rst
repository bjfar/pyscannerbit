Welcome to pyScannerBit!
========================================

pyScannerBit is a Python interface to the `GAMBIT`_ library of scanning
algorithms, called `ScannerBit`_

It is still in an "alpha" stage of development, but if you are brave then
you are encouraged to give it a try! Please report any bugs/problems you
encounter on `github`_.

For installation instructions see :ref:`installation`, and see the :ref:`quick start` guide to get your first scan up and running!
